# CI Fix Summary: GitHub Actions Deprecation Resolution

**Date**: October 2, 2025  
**Issue**: GitHub Actions workflow failures due to deprecated action versions  
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

---

## 🐛 Problem Identified

### Error Report from GitHub Actions

All 4 CI jobs failed with the same deprecation error:

```
❌ Windows MSVC C++20
❌ Windows MSVC C++23 Experimental  
❌ Ubuntu GCC C++20
❌ Ubuntu Clang C++20
```

**Error Message**:
```
This request has been automatically failed because it uses a deprecated 
version of `actions/upload-artifact: v3`.

```

### Root Cause

The workflow `.github/workflows/ci.yml` was using **deprecated versions** of GitHub Actions:
- `actions/checkout@v3` → Deprecated, should use **v4**
- `actions/upload-artifact@v3` → Deprecated, should use **v4**

GitHub deprecated these versions as of April 16, 2024, and began enforcing the deprecation on October 2, 2025.

## ✅ Solution Applied

### Changes Made

Updated all GitHub Actions to their latest stable versions:

| Action | Old Version | New Version | Occurrences |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| `actions/checkout` | v3 | **v4** | 2 locations |
| `actions/upload-artifact` | v3 | **v4** | 1 location |

## 🔄 Expected CI Behavior

### Re-triggered Workflow

The push automatically triggered a **new CI run** with the fixed workflow.

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ **Windows MSVC C++20** — Build, test, upload artifacts
- ✅ **Windows MSVC C++23 Experimental** — Build, test, upload artifacts
- ✅ **Ubuntu GCC C++20** — Build, test, upload artifacts
- ✅ **Ubuntu Clang C++20** — Build, test, upload artifacts
- ✅ **Performance Regression Check** — Benchmark validation

### Validation Checklist

| Step | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Checkout code** | ✅ Expected | Using `actions/checkout@v4` |
| **Configure CMake** | ✅ Expected | Platform-specific configurations |
| **Build library** | ✅ Expected | Parallel build with all targets |
| **Run tests** | ✅ Expected | 95 unit tests via CTest |
| **Memory visualizer** | ✅ Expected | Smoke test + JSON export |
| **DAG visualizer** | ✅ Expected | Smoke test + DOT export |
| **Upload artifacts** | ✅ Expected | Using `actions/upload-artifact@v4` |
| **Run benchmarks** | ✅ Expected | Performance regression validation |

## 📊 Impact Analysis

### Before Fix
- **4 jobs failed** — All due to deprecated actions
- **0 tests executed** — Jobs terminated before test stage
- **No artifacts uploaded** — Upload step unreachable

### After Fix
- **4 jobs expected to pass** — Using supported action versions
- **95 tests per job** — Full test suite execution
- **Artifacts uploaded** — Test results, memory snapshots, DOT graphs

---

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Why v3 → v4?

**`actions/checkout@v4`**:
- Adds support for Node.js 20 (v3 uses deprecated Node.js 16)
- Improved caching performance
- Better handling of Git submodules
- Security patches

**`actions/upload-artifact@v4`**:
- Adds support for Node.js 20
- Improved compression algorithms (faster uploads)
- Better handling of large file sets
- Automatic artifact retention policies

### Breaking Changes

**None** — v4 is backward compatible with v3 usage patterns. The workflow requires no syntax changes beyond the version number.

## ⚠️ Lessons Learned

### Best Practices

1. **Pin action versions**: Always specify exact versions (e.g., `@v4`) to avoid breaking changes
2. **Monitor GitHub changelogs**: Subscribe to https://github.blog/changelog for deprecation notices
3. **Regular maintenance**: Update actions quarterly to stay ahead of deprecations
4. **Test workflow changes**: Use workflow_dispatch to manually trigger test runs

### Prevention Strategy

- **Add calendar reminder**: Check GitHub Actions marketplace quarterly
- **Enable Dependabot**: Auto-create PRs for action updates
- **CI monitoring**: Set up alerts for failed workflow runs

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Within 5 Minutes)

1. **Monitor CI Run**:
   ```
   Visit: https://github.com/holy-bit/SoulLib/actions
   Expected: All 4 jobs should now PASS ✅
   Duration: ~10-15 minutes per job
   ```

2. **Verify Artifacts**:
   - Check that test results are uploaded
   - Confirm memory snapshots are present
   - Validate DAG DOT files are generated

### Short-Term (Within 1 Hour)

3. **Tag Release** (after CI passes):
   ```bash
   git tag -a v0.3.0 -m "Release v0.3.0: Documentation & Tooling Sprint"
   git push origin v0.3.0
   ```

4. **Create GitHub Release**:
   - Use `docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.3.0.md` as body
   - Attach CI artifacts (optional)

### Long-Term (Future Releases)

5. **Enable Dependabot**:
   Create `.github/dependabot.yml`:
   ```yaml
   version: 2
   updates:
     - package-ecosystem: "github-actions"
       directory: "/"
       schedule:
         interval: "weekly"
   ```

6. **Add CI Badge to README**:
   ```markdown
   ![CI](https://github.com/holy-bit/SoulLib/workflows/SoulLib%20CI/badge.svg)
   ```
